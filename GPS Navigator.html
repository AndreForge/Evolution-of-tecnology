			<h1>GPS Navigator - The 90's</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
			The GPS Navigator was created to get the information to go somewhere in the easiest way.

			<h2>Production period</h2>
			<p>
			In 1991 the USA opened the service to the world under the name SPS (Standard Positioning System), with specifications differentiated from the military ones called PPS (Precision Positioning System). In practice, the so-called Selective Availability (SA) was introduced with the purpose to return intentional errors in satellite signals in order to reduce the accuracy of the detection, allowing precision only in the order of 100-150 m.<br>The GPS system replaced the transit, when the US, gave up Selective Availability which supported it with a network of 24 artificial satellites.

			<h2>Fuctions</h2>
			<p>
			The GPS system replaced the transit, when the US, gave up Selective Availability which supported it with a network of 24 artificial satellites. <br>Like any other GPS device, the navigator uses the so-called triangulation system, which determines the position of an object anywhere on the planet knowing the distance from at least three distinct points. To practically implement this approach, therefore, the navigator constantly communicates with three different satellites, calculating the position of the vehicle with remarkable precision.

			<h2>Design and dimension</h2>
			<p>
			The GPS navigator does not have a particular size, it depends on the model, the average size of the screen is 5 to 7 inches. Some models also have a touchscreen, that is easier to use. <br>The GPS navigator is also very good for its portability.

			<h2>Price</h2>
			<p>
			The price goes from <strong>20$ to 400$</strong>, it depends on the model and on the screen dimensions.
			</p>
			<h2>Comparison with current devices	</h2>
			<p>
			The first navigators used a system based on SPS (Standard Positioning System), while today’s navigators use a system based on GPS (Global Positioning System).<br>In the past years it was common to use a navigator, while right now, if you need to go somewhere and you don’t know how to get there you can simply just use your mobile phone to select the destination and follow the instructions.
